Current Situation:
Email communication contains vast amounts of unstructured data that can provide
insights into business processes, workflows, and organizational structures. However,
manually extracting key information from emails is time-consuming and inefficient. Our
company aims to leverage AI to automate the extraction of valuable insights from emails,
such as topics, entities, tasks, timelines, and summaries.
One key opportunity is to develop robust models capable of extracting actionable
intelligence. This solution has potential applications in streamlining workflow automation,
creating relational graphs of organizational interactions, and integrating email-based task
extraction into productivity tools.
Project Goals:
1. Develop an AI-powered email data extraction system.
2. Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to identify and extract:
a. Topics
b. Entities (people, organizations, locations)
c. Tasks and associated timelines
d. Summaries of email content
3. Generate an organizational, relational and temporal graph from email interactions (implemented in Neo4j)
4. Enhance productivity by automating the conversion of extracted tasks into
structured to-do lists or schedules (including owner, deliverable, start date and due date).
5. Develop an AI agent capable of performing these extractions and integrating with graphing, productivity and or scheduling tools.
Project Deliverables:
AI model capable of extracting topics, entities, tasks, timelines, and summaries from emails.
A structured dataset containing extracted insights from the email corpus.
A visualization or organizational/relational graph.
A proof-of-concept AI agent for task extraction and scheduling integration.
A final report detailing methodology, findings, and recommendations.
A presentation summarizing project outcomes and potential business applications.
Descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive components
Descriptive: Identify and classify email content into structured categories (topics, entities, tasks, etc.).
Predictive: Develop machine learning models to predict potential tasks and associated timelines from emails.
Prescriptive: Provide AI-driven recommendations for automating task management and scheduling based on extracted insights.
