## üîÑ ETL Pipeline Overview

This application implements a robust **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline for email-based task management:

### **Extract** üì•
- **Source**: Gmail Takeout `.mbox` files
- **Smart Filtering**: Date range, keywords, content length, email types
- **Email Parsing**: Structured extraction of metadata (From, To, Subject, Body, Message-ID)
- **Content Processing**: First 200MB processed for optimal performance

### **Transform** ‚öôÔ∏è
- **RAG-Enhanced Extraction**: For each email, the system retrieves similar email chunks from your dataset using a local vector index (e.g., FAISS or in-memory embeddings). The LLM prompt is constructed with the main email and up to two related email chunks as additional context. The LLM then extracts structured entities (tasks, people, dates, etc.) from the email, grounded in both the email and its context.
- **LLM Processing**: LangGraph pipeline uses GPT-4 to convert unstructured email content into structured JSON
- **Entity Extraction**: Tasks, people, roles, departments, organizations, dates
- **Data Validation**: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) validation for data quality
- **Graph Construction**: Hierarchical node formatting with relationship mapping (all via Neo4j Cypher)
- **Semantic Enrichment**: Vector embeddings for similarity search and topic matching (Neo4j vector index)

### **Load** üìä
- **Neo4j Graph Database**: Master knowledge graph with enhanced node hierarchy, persistent and scalable
- **Multiple Interfaces**: 
  - **Tabular View**: Flattened task data in Main Page
  - **Calendar View**: Time-based visualization
  - **Graph Database**: Interactive GraphRAG query system (Neo4j backend)

### **Query & Analytics** üîç
- **GraphRAG**: Topic-centered semantic search with graph traversal (Neo4j)
- **Natural Language Interface**: Conversational AI chatbot (LangChain agent)
- **Interactive Visualization**: Pyvis-based interactive graph visualization with drag-and-drop, zoom, and filtering capabilities

This ETL approach ensures reliable, scalable processing of large email datasets while maintaining data quality through validation workflows and persistent graph storage in Neo4j.

## üß† End-to-End Pipeline

1. **User Uploads .mbox Email File**
   - Source: Gmail Takeout
   - Format: `.mbox` file
2. **Preprocessing / Filtering**
   - Extracts metadata (Message-ID, Subject, Date, From, To, CC, Body)
   - Filters out auto-notifications, empty/short replies, out-of-range dates
3. **LangGraph Extraction Pipeline**
   - Nodes: chunk embedding, context retrieval, prompt generation, LLM JSON extraction, validation, HITL, write to Neo4j
   - Pauses for user correction if extraction is invalid
4. **Neo4j Knowledge Graph Storage**
   - All entities and relationships stored in Neo4j with rich schema
   - Embeddings stored as vector properties for semantic search
5. **Neo4j Vector Indexing**
   - Fast topic and node similarity search using native vector index
6. **LangChain Agent Q&A**
   - Natural language queries answered via LangChain agent with Cypher generation and answer formatting
   - Supports advanced, multi-hop graph queries
7. **Streamlit UI**
   - Main Page: Upload, process, validate, view tasks
   - Calendar View: Visualize tasks by due date
   - AI Chatbot: Conversational Q&A with interactive Pyvis graph visualization and query tips
   - HITL Modal: Edit/approve invalid extractions

## üîç Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Validation

- Pipeline pauses for user review if:
  - JSON parsing fails
  - JSON is missing required fields
  - No JSON extracted from email
  - Email metadata is inconsistent/incomplete
- User can edit/correct extraction and resume pipeline

---

## üß† Conversational Q&A (LangChain Agent)

- User enters a natural language query (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat tasks are due next week?‚Äù)
- LangChain agent:
  1. Performs semantic search (Neo4j vector index)
  2. Generates Cypher queries for Neo4j
  3. Formats answers using LLM
  4. Streams results to UI
- Supports multi-hop, context-rich queries and answer formatting
